 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
 * of two given nodes in the BST.
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
 * “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T
 * that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 *
 * Note:
 * All of the nodes' values will be unique.
 * p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
